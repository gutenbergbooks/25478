<div class='unindent'><br /><br />H, Madge, just stay as you are;
there&mdash;your head a little more
turned this way."</div>

<p>"But, Raymond, I can't possibly
make the toast if I do."</p>

<p>"Never mind the toast; I shan't be many
minutes," said the boy who was painting in
the window, while he mixed some colours in
an excited, eager manner.</p>

<p>"The fire is very hot. Mayn't I move
just to one side?"</p>

<p>"No; it is the way that the firelight is
falling on your hair and cheek that I want.
Please, Madge; five minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," and the patient little sister
dropped the toasting-fork, and folded her
hands in her lap, with the scorching blaze
playing on her forehead and cheek, and
sparkling in her deep brown eyes.</p>

<p>The boy went on with rapid, bold strokes,
while a smile played over his compressed
lips as he glanced at Madge every few
moments.</p>

<p>"The very thing I have been watching
for&mdash;that warm, delicious glow&mdash;that red
light slanting over her face;&mdash;glorious!"
and he shook back the hair from his forehead,
and worked on unconscious of how the
minutes flew by.</p>

<p>"Raymond, it is very hot."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;one moment more, please,
Madge."</p>

<p>One minute&mdash;two&mdash;three, fled by, and
then Raymond threw down his brush and
came over to his sister's side.</p>

<p>"Poor little Madge," and he laid his
hand coaxingly on her silky hair. "Perhaps
you have made my fortune."</p>

<p>This was some small consolation for
having roasted her face, and she went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
look at the picture. "I'm not as pretty
as that, Raymond."</p>

</div>

<p>Raymond Leicester had not a prepossessing
face; it was heavy, and to a casual observer,
stupid. He had dark hazel eyes, shaded by
an overhanging brow and rather sweeping
eyelashes; a straight nose, and compressed
lips, hiding a row of defective teeth; a high
massive forehead and light hair, which was
seldom smooth, but very straight. This he
had a habit of tossing back with a jerk when
he was excited; and sometimes the dull eyes
flashed with a very bright sparkle in them
when he caught an idea which pleased him,&mdash;for
Raymond was an artist, not by profession,
but because it was in his heart to
paint, and he could not help himself. He
was sixteen now, and Madge was twelve.
Madge was the only thing in the world that
he really cared for, except his pictures.
Their mother was dead, Madge could hardly
remember her; but Raymond always had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
an image before him of a tender, sorrowful
woman, who used to hold him in her arms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and whisper to him, while the hot tears
fell upon his baby cheeks,&mdash;"<i>You</i> will
comfort me, my little son. <i>You</i> will take
care of your mother and of baby Madge."
And he remembered the cottage in the
country where they had lived, the porch
where the rose-tree grew, the orchard and
the moss-grown well, the tall white lilies in
the garden that stood like fairies guarding
the house, and the pear-tree that was laden
with fruit.</p>

<p>He remembered how his mother had sat
in that porch with him, reading stories to
him out of the Bible, but often lifting her
sad pale face and looking down the road as
if watching for some one.</p>

<p>And then there came a dark, dreary night,
when the wind was howling mournfully
round the cottage and their mother lay
dying. She had called Raymond to her,
and had pressed her cold lips on his forehead,
telling him to take care of Madge;
and if his father ever came, to say that she
had loved him to the end, and she had
prayed God to bless him and to take care of
her children. Then she had died, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
neighbours told Raymond that he was
motherless.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/illus_013.png" width="296" height="400" alt="THE DYING MOTHER." title="THE DYING MOTHER." />
<span class="caption">THE DYING MOTHER.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>He recollected how the sun shone brightly
on the day that she was buried, and that he
and Madge stood by the grave crying, when
she was put down in the cold earth; and
that a man rode up to the paling of the
quiet green churchyard, and threw the reins
over his horse's neck, and came with hurried
footsteps to the grave just as the last sod
was thrown upon the coffin; and how this
man had sobbed and cried, and had caught
them in his arms, and said, "My poor little
motherless ones," and had kissed them and
cried again so piteously and wildly, that the
clergyman had stopped in the service and
had tried to comfort him. And when the
funeral was over, and the neighbours were
taking the little ones home, how the man
had held them tightly and said, "No; mine
now, never to leave me again. I am their
father. Margaret, I will try to make up to
them what I withheld from you; is it too
late?"</p>

<p>This was the father whom their mother
had spoken of with her dying breath; but
who had come too late to implore her forgiveness
for having left her in want, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he squandered his money upon his own
pleasure. But now, in the impulse of grief
and remorse, he had determined to act differently,
and returned to London with his
children.</p>

<p>Here they had lived ever since. Their
father had returned to his old gay life, and
left the children very much to take care of
themselves. Sometimes carelessly kind to
them, more often harsh and impatient, Mr.
Leicester supposed that he fulfilled the vow
which he had made about her children,
beside his wife's grave.</p>

<p>Raymond and Madge had no very definite
idea as to what their father did with his
time. From time to time they changed
their lodgings, always coming to some
quieter ones, and now they had got to the
highest flight of a tall house in a very
shady street. Their father was not at home
very often, but they did not mind this much,
and were very happy together.</p>

<p>Raymond made a little money by drawing
pictures for a cheap periodical, and with
this he bought materials for his darling
pursuit. Madge watched him and gloried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in him, and dusted the rooms, and laid the
table for meals, and mended his clothes, and
thought hopefully of the time when Raymond
should be a famous painter, and she
should leave the dingy London lodging and
live in the fresh breezy country which her
brother told her about.</p>

<p>Madge was not beautiful; her little face
was sallow and pinched: but she had two
pretty things about her. One was her hair,
which was of a rich warm brown colour,
with a dash of chestnut in it, and when unbound
it fell in ripples nearly to her feet;
the other was her eyes&mdash;large, lustrous,
brown eyes&mdash;with an intense earnestness in
them, seldom to be seen in one so young.
These eyes appeared in every one of Raymond's
pictures, for they haunted him.</p>

<p>"Now, Raymond, come to breakfast,"
Madge said when she had finished making
the toast.</p>

<p>He did not appear to hear her, for he
went to a little distance and surveyed his
picture with his head on one side.</p>

<p>Madge poured out the tea, and then came
over to him, laid her hand on his which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
held the brush, and said entreatingly,
"Come."</p>

<p>"Well, it is too bad," he said laughingly,
"first to make you roast your face, and then
to keep you from eating your breakfast;"
and he laid down his brush and pallette and
came to the table; but he ate hurriedly and
soon returned to his work.</p>

<p>Madge put away the things and brought
her sewing to the window, where she sat all
the morning watching Raymond's busy
fingers. Then she went out to the colour-shop
at the end of the next street, to buy
something which her brother wanted, and to
see if the picture he had left there was sold.</p>

<p>Alas! it was still in the window along
with several others; a few butchers' boys,
working-men, and ragged little girls were
eagerly pressing their faces against the glass
looking at the pictures, but none of them
were likely to be purchasers. Raymond's
picture was called "The Welcome." There
was a cottage room, and an open door,
through which a working man was coming
in, while a little girl sprang to meet him.
The girl had Madge's eyes; but no one in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that wondering throng knew that. They
were saying how well the workman's dress
and the tools which he carried were done.</p>

<span class="caption">BUSY FINGERS.</span>
</div>

<p>Madge went into the shop. Mr. Jeffery
was talking to a gentleman who stood by
the counter; but he turned to serve her as
soon as she appeared.</p>

<p>She laid down her money and took her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tiny parcel, then said falteringly, while the
colour came into her pale cheeks, "Please,
sir, is my brother's picture sold yet?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, nor likely to be," said Mr.
Jeffery, laughing.</p>

<p>"Poor Raymond," thought Madge, and
as she turned away, she raised her hand to
brush away the tears which filled her eyes.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had been standing,
now stepped forward and opened the door
for the little girl to go out.</p>

<p>She raised her face timidly and said,
"Thank you, sir," in a soft, low tone, then
hurried off without trusting herself again to
look in at the shop window.</p>

<p>"Who's that, Jeffery?"</p>

<p>"A little girl who comes here very often,
sir. Her brother paints a little, and he's
left a picture here to try and get it sold."</p>

<p>"I should like to have her hair and eyes
for a model," the artist said. "Jeffery, if
that child comes again send her up to me;
she would exactly do for my Ruth."</p>

<p>But it was many and many a long day
before little Madge came to that shop
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE RESOLVE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 74px;">
<img src="images/illus_020b_t.png" width="74" height="130" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />HAT same evening, when it was too
dark for Raymond to paint, he and
Madge sat by the fire talking.</div>

<p>"It's not much good trying any
more; is it, Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Trying what?"</p>

<p>"Why, your painting, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Madge, I must paint; it's
my life to paint."</p>

<p>Madge gave a long deep sigh, too long
and deep for a child of her age.</p>

<p>"Raymond, what's <i>my</i> life?"</p>

<p>"Woman's life is to glory in man," said
Raymond grandly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Madge, with an unbelieving
laugh, "there's more than that in it; there's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a great deal of work, too, I can assure
you."</p>

<p>"I daresay," Raymond answered carelessly;
"but, Madge, you must never talk
of my giving up painting, because I should
die if I did."</p>

<p>"Should you? O Raymond, don't."</p>

<p>"No, I won't until I have done something
great&mdash;something to make you proud of me&mdash;something
which shall make my name to
be remembered;" and the boy's eyes flashed
now, but it was too dark for any one to
see it.</p>

<p>Madge liked to hear him say these kind
of things, though she was not an artist herself,
only a patient, loving little girl, who
thought there was no one in the world like
Raymond, and she put out her hand and
laid it softly upon his, as if she would lay
her claim to that by which his fame was to
come.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for some time&mdash;Raymond
looking into the fire, and thinking of
his future; Madge looking at him, and wondering
if she should ever see him as famous
as she felt sure he ought to be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The door was opened suddenly, and their
father came in. Even with streaks of gray
in his hair, and deep lines upon his face, Mr.
Leicester was handsome; and he had a gay,
dashing air, that heightened the charm of his
appearance. He carelessly kissed Madge,
and laid his hand on Raymond's shoulder,
then sat down by the fire.</p>

<p>"It's cold to-night, children."</p>

<p>"Yes, father; shall I get tea?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, sweet Madge. I must be
off soon; I have an engagement. I only
looked in to see how you were getting on."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Raymond gruffly.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's right; I'm glad to hear it."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, then Mr. Leicester
said abruptly, "Raymond, lad, I've found
some work for you at last."</p>

<p>Raymond started. He had long ago
found work for himself, and did not want
any other.</p>

<p>"Stephens and Johnson will shortly have
a vacancy, and then you can go to them as
soon as you like."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, that they want a shop-boy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Raymond stood up proudly. "I'm a
gentleman, father."</p>

<p>"Come, come, never mind that. We
know all that; but I don't want heroics.
You must either work or starve."</p>

<p>"I'm working."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! A little desultory dabbling
in painting; let me tell you, Master
Raymond, that is not my idea of work."</p>

<p>"But, father, I must paint; I could not
live if I did not."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; that is all the ridiculous
ideas that you get up here. When you are
shaken out in the world you will lose them."</p>

<p>Raymond's hands were raised to his face,
and he was shivering with excitement.
Madge came to her father's side, and put
one hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Father, Raymond is a painter. If you
were to send him to a shop, he would be a
painter still. You cannot crush out what is
bound up in his heart. Is it not better for
him to rise to fame by painting? Some day
he will be your glory and mine."</p>

<p>Mr. Leicester shook her hand off.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
about. Little girls should hold their tongues,
and learn to be silent."</p>

<p>Madge shrank back immediately, and her
father went on fiercely. "I'll tell you what
it is, children; I'm off to-night to the Continent,
and that's all the cash I can leave
you," and he produced three sovereigns. "I
can't find bread enough for all of us. Raymond
<i>must</i> work. I shall be gone for a
month. The place will not be ready for
him before that. When I return he must
go immediately."</p>

<p>Madge breathed more freely&mdash;there was
a month's reprieve, and she stretched out
her hand to Raymond. He clutched it,
and held it in a vice-like grasp.</p>

<p>"Father," he said at last, and his voice
was low and hoarse, "I want to ask you
something."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You are not coming back for a month.
If during that time I can sell one of my
pictures, and can hand you over a reasonable
sum of money, may I go on painting?"</p>

<p>His father thought for a moment, then
laughed. "Yes, safe enough. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you'll know what it is to be hungry before
the month's out, and will be glad enough to
leave off your dabbling."</p>

<p>Then he stood up&mdash;patted Madge's head&mdash;went
to the door, and came back again as
if seized with a new impulse&mdash;shook hands
with Raymond, and kissed his little daughter's
forehead. "Good-bye, children; take
care of yourselves," and he went away.
Then Madge came to Raymond's side, and
he laid his head upon her shoulder with a
low piteous cry.</p>

<p>"Hush, darling, hush," she whispered.
"It will all come right, don't fear. Let us
trust God; he has given you this talent for
painting, and he will teach you how to use
it. There's a whole month, and who knows
what may happen in that time! You may
become famous." She went on earnestly;
but he took no notice&mdash;only pressed his
hands tighter and closer over his throbbing
forehead.</p>

<p>"Raymond, I know you will be an artist&mdash;a
great one&mdash;some day," whispered Madge.</p>

<p>"Never, never, if I am to be ground down
in a shop," he groaned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE LITTLE COMFORTER.</span>
</div>

<p>"You will, you will," she answered, throwing
her arm round his neck. "If you keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up a brave, strong heart, and are not discouraged.
Nobody can do anything if they lose
heart."</p>

<p>"But to be always, always working, and
to have no success. O Madge, it is so hard
and bitter!"</p>

<p>"No success! Why, Raymond, if you'd
only heard how the errand-boys praised the
way you had done the workman's basket
of tools in the <i>Welcome</i>. It was a success
in itself."</p>

<p>In spite of himself Raymond laughed,
and Madge was satisfied. She went on
brightly. "Some day I shall be so proud
to be the sister of Mr. Raymond Leicester,
the great painter, whose picture will be one
of the gems in the Royal Academy some
year or other; and we shall glory in you."</p>

<p>"Not he&mdash;never; he would <i>never</i> care."</p>

<p>"Oh, he would&mdash;he would; and if he
didn't, you would be mine&mdash;all mine," she
added softly, as she laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>Raymond looked up suddenly. "Madge,
you are a witch, I think. I wonder what
those men do who have no sisters&mdash;poor
fellows;" and then he kissed her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a glad light in Madge's eyes
then. He so seldom did this, except for
good-night and good-morning, that she knew
what it meant. She was very silent for a
few minutes, then sprang up, exclaiming,
"Now we must have tea, and then you
have your etching to do, and I am going to
pay up the rent, and then I'll read to you,
and do my sums."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE FEVER.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 77px;">
<img src="images/illus_029b_a.png" width="77" height="140" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />ND Raymond did work. Madge
watched him with hopeful pride,
and seldom stirred from his side.
Their small store of money was
nearly gone, and there seemed but
little likelihood of a fresh supply.</div>

<p>Raymond's hopes were bound up in the
picture he was then engaged upon. If only
he could finish that, he felt sure that he
could sell it. There was a feverish light in
his eyes, a burning flush upon his cheeks,
while he worked. He spoke seldom; but
Madge saw him raise his hand sometimes to
his forehead as if in pain. The picture was
nearly done, and Raymond looked up for a
minute one morning, and saw that the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was shining brightly down on the sea of
roofs and chimney-pots which for the most
part constituted the view from their garret
window, and then he said to Madge, "Go
out, and get a breath of fresh air; it is stifling
work for you to be always up here."</p>

<p>"Shan't you want me to mix your colours,
Raymond?"</p>

<p>"No; go. I should rather you went."</p>

<p>She put on her bonnet, and then stood
for one moment looking at his work. "I
wish you would come with me; it would do
you good, and rest you."</p>

<p>Raymond gave a wearying sigh. "No
rest for me yet, Madge. I must toil on
until this is done. I can't rest when I go
to bed. I am thinking all night when will
the morning come, that I may be at work
again. No, no; there is no rest until this
is sold. Do you know that in a day or two
we shall be penniless and starving?"</p>

<p>Madge looked up at him with a smile.
"No, Raymond, we shan't be left to starve;
don't fear."</p>

<p>Raymond looked doubtful, and went on
with his work, and Madge went out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt very lonely and sad as she wandered
through the crowded, busy streets, and
gazed into the faces of the passers-by, all
were so completely wrapped up in their own
concerns. None knew her history; none
would care to know it. What did it matter
to any one of that moving throng if she and
Raymond died?</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously she bent her steps
in the direction of the colour-shop. One
hurried glance she cast at the window,
and then turned away with a sickening
heart.</p>

<p>Raymond's picture was still there.</p>

<p>She went home, and ascended the long
flight of stairs with a slow, hesitating step.
For a moment she paused at the door of
their own room; she heard a groan within,
and hastily went in. Her first glance was
directed to the easel in the window; but
Raymond was not there. Another look
discovered him lying on the floor with his
head pressed against the ground.</p>

<p>"Raymond, Raymond!" she cried as she
threw herself down by him. "Dear Raymond,
what is the matter?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 193px;">
<img src="images/illus_032.png" width="193" height="300" alt="THE COLOUR-SHOP WINDOW." title="THE COLOUR-SHOP WINDOW." />
<span class="caption">THE COLOUR-SHOP WINDOW.</span>
</div>

<p>"O Madge, my head, my head! I could
not bear it any longer."</p>

<p>He raised it for a moment, and Madge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
caught a sight of his fevered cheeks and
heavy tired eyes. She thought for an instant
what was best to be done, then ran
down-stairs to call their landlady. Now,
Mrs. Smiley was in the midst of her cooking
operations, and as she bent over her large
saucepan, she did not like being interrupted
by the sudden appearance of one of her top
lodgers.</p>

<p>"What do you want? Don't you see I'm
busy?" she said roughly, as she turned a very
red face round from the fire to Madge.</p>

<p>But Madge, in her terror for Raymond,
gained courage. "If you please, ma'am, do
come and see Raymond; he is so ill, and I
don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"And who's to take this saucepan off, I
should like to know, or baste the meat? Do
you think I'm to be at the beck and call of
top-flight lodgers, who only pay five shillings
a-week, and that not regular. I can
tell you then that you're in the wrong box,
young woman, so you'd best be off."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;">

<span class="caption">AN UNGRACIOUS LANDLADY.</span>
</div>

<p>Madge turned to go, but still stood irresolute,
and Mrs. Smiley, looking round to
enforce her injunction, caught a sight of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wistful, terrified face. The little girl went
away as directed; but as soon as she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gone, Mrs. Smiley opened the door of the
back-kitchen, and called out, "Here, you
Polly, come up here, and keep an eye on
this dinner. Now keep basting the meat
properly; for if it's burnt, I'll baste you
when I come back;" and then she followed
Madge up-stairs. She found her kneeling
beside Raymond, supporting his head upon
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Raymond, so you don't find
yourself very well!"</p>

<p>A groan was her only answer, and Madge
looked imploringly at her.</p>

<p>"You'd best go to bed, sir, I'm thinking.&mdash;Miss
Madge, my dear, you're in for a bit
of nursing. I'm afeard it's a fever that's
on him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smiley's character was changed.
She had children of her own, and there
were soft spots in her heart still, though
the outer coat, formed by her worldly business,
was hard and rough. She had known
what sickness was, and she was rather a
skilful nurse, so from that time whatever
spare minutes she had were devoted to Raymond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor little Madge! The days that followed
were very sad ones. Her brother
grew worse and worse, and she sat by his
bedside listening to his wild ravings of
delirium, in vain endeavouring to soothe
him, or to allay his burning thirst.</p>

<p>Their scanty supply of money was exhausted;
and many little comforts which
Raymond needed, his sister was unable to
procure for him. "I must do something;
this cannot go on," she thought; and then
an idea flashed into her mind, which she
longed to carry out. She went over to the
easel, and took down Raymond's picture.
It was very nearly finished. "I will go
and see if Mr. Jeffery will buy it," she said;
and covering it under her little cloak, she
set out.</p>

<p>Very timidly she presented herself at the
counter, and produced her picture. Mr.
Jeffery looked at it. "This is not finished,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"No, sir; Raymond was too ill to finish
it."</p>

<p>"I cannot take it in this state," said the
picture-dealer. "It will never sell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/illus_037.png" width="295" height="400" alt="NO HOPE." title="NO HOPE." />
<span class="caption">NO HOPE.</span>
</div>

<p>"Then you can do nothing for us?" asked
Madge sadly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing. Stay, though;" and he began
turning over the leaves of his memorandum-book.
"Yes, you are the child. Well, Mr.
Smith&mdash;Mr. Herbert Smith&mdash;the great
artist, wants to see you. Here, take this
direction and give it to him when you find
his house;" and Mr. Jeffery hastily wrote a
few lines upon a piece of paper, and handed
it to Madge.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Smith, the great artist.
Yes! she had heard Raymond speak of his
pictures&mdash;she would go; there was a gleam
of hope before her; she would take Raymond's
picture to him; he could not fail to
discover how clever it was&mdash;Raymond could
only be appreciated by master minds, and
this was one of them. It was a dull wet
day, and the streets looked dark and dingy;
the rain was driving in her face, and her
heart was with Raymond in the garret,
where he was tossing in restless fever; but
the brave little maiden went on steadily,
until she reached Mr. Herbert Smith's
door.</p>

<p>She rang at the bell, and asked to see the
artist. The servant, well accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
receiving every variety in the way of visitors
to his master, models, &amp;c., &amp;c., ushered her
up a long stair into the studio.</p>

<p>Why, there sat the gentleman who had once
looked so kindly at her in the picture-shop;
she had often wondered who he could be.</p>

<p>"A little girl to see you, sir," said the
servant, and then withdrew. Mr. Smith
was reading his newspaper, seated in an
easy-chair, arrayed in dressing-gown and
slippers, with a cigar in his mouth, and a
cup of fragrant coffee by his side.</p>

<p>He turned round impatiently, but when
he saw Madge, his expression changed to
one of easy good-humour.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeffery&mdash;please, sir, he told me to
come to you," said little Madge, while she
looked down on the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember; and so you have
come to give me a sitting?"</p>

<p>"A what, sir?"</p>

<p>"A sitting, my child; to let me paint
your eyes and hair."</p>

<p>"Please sir, I came to show you this;
Raymond's ill;" and she held out the
cherished picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/illus_040.png" width="209" height="325" alt="THE GREAT ARTIST." title="THE GREAT ARTIST." />
<span class="caption">THE GREAT ARTIST.</span>
</div>

<p>"Ah, yes; lay it down. I'll look at it
presently; but, meanwhile, I must lose no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
time in transferring you to canvas. Now,
then, take your place, so; your head a little
more turned to the light." And in a few
minutes, with easy, rapid strokes, the artist
was progressing in his work.</p>

<p>"And what is your name, my little girl?"
he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Madge Leicester," she replied softly.</p>

<p>"Your eyes have grown sadder than they
were when I last saw you, Madge!" They
were very sad then, for large tears were
gathering in them, and rolling down the
thin white cheeks.</p>

<p>She raised her hand and dashed them
away.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"O Raymond, Raymond!" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Is Raymond your brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you a father and mother?"</p>

<p>"My mother is dead, and my father is
away, and Raymond is ill."</p>

<p>"Poor child, where do you live?"</p>

<p>Madge told him.</p>

<p>"And does no one care for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Raymond does."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I mean, does no one do anything
for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Smiley is minding him while
I'm out!"</p>

<p>"How did you come to leave him to-day?"</p>

<p>A quick flush came to Madge's cheek; she
was ashamed to confess their poverty; but
after a moment she added, "I wanted to
sell Raymond's picture."</p>

<p>"Does Raymond like painting?"</p>

<p>Madge's face lit up with a sudden brightness.
"Yes, yes! he loves it&mdash;he delights
in it&mdash;he says it is his life."</p>

<p>"Poor boy, he does not know what up-hill
work it is; he thinks it is mere fancy
play, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he does, sir."</p>

<p>"Has he ever had teaching?"</p>

<p>"Only a few lessons from an artist who
had the down-stair rooms in the last house
where we lodged."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith came over suddenly, and unfastened
Madge's hair; it fell in golden
ripples all over her neck. The light was
shining upon it, and the sunbeams danced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
about it, making it in some places to resemble&mdash;</p>

<p>
"In gloss and hue, the chestnut, when the shell<br />
Divides threefold to show the fruit within;"<br />
</p>

<p>and in others there were luxuriant masses
of rich deep brown, clustering in curls
about her shoulders. For a moment the
artist stood lost in admiration; then he
silently resumed his work. It was an enjoyment
to him, as Madge could see from
the pleasant smile that played around his
lips, and the kindly look in his eyes, when
he glanced at her; but the poor, little,
anxious sister was only longing for the time
to be over, that she might return to Raymond's
side; and when at last Mr. Smith
laid down his brushes and pallette, saying,
"I will not keep you longer to-day," she
sprang to her feet joyfully.</p>

<p>"Will you come again soon, Madge?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if I can!"</p>

<p>"Well, this is for your first sitting;" and
he held her out half-a-crown. For a moment
she hesitated, then she thought of
Raymond, and the nourishment he so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
needed, and she took it. "And about the
picture, sir?" she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, about the picture," said Mr.
Smith, taking it up; but at this moment he
was interrupted; the servant announced a
visitor, and he had only time to add, "I
will tell you about the picture the next time
you come, little Madge; good-bye;" and
then she had to go away.</p>

<p>Back through the dreary streets, to that
dreary home; back to that garret room, to
that lonely watching, to that brother who
lay so near the borders of the grave, though
Madge knew it not. How often we pass in
the crowded thoroughfare some sad suffering
hearts, hurrying back to scenes such as these;
it may be that they touch us in the crowd,
and yet we know nothing of the burden
which they carry; God help them! Let us
thank him if we have light hearts ourselves;
and let us remember that each load that we
lighten leaves one less sad face and heavy
heart in the world about us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE FRIEND.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 73px;">
<img src="images/illus_045b_a.png" width="73" height="130" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br /> &nbsp; WEEK passed, and Mr. Smith
saw nothing more of Madge. Raymond
had become worse, and she
never left him.</div>

<p>It was Saturday evening, about
five o'clock, when Mrs. Smiley was
called up from the kitchen by hearing that
a gentleman wanted to speak to her. She
came up, smoothing down her apron with
her hands, which were not of the cleanest.</p>

<p>"Do two children of the name of Leicester
live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, surely; at least there were
two of 'em a couple of hours ago, but I
can't rightly say whether the lad's alive
yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"What! is he so ill, then?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, ill enough, I warrant."</p>

<p>"I will go up to them."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; I'm sure if you're a
friend that'll do something for them, I'm
right glad to see you, for they sorely need
one."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, for it was he, followed Polly's
guidance to Raymond's room, then thanking
her, he knocked at the door himself, and
entered.</p>

<p>Madge was leaning over the sick boy,
holding a glass of water to his lips; and as
she looked round, Mr. Smith thought he
had never seen a face so strangely and
sadly altered as hers. It had lost nearly
all its childishness&mdash;it looked so old, and
womanly, with a weight of care in it that
was pitiable to see; and yet, with all this,
it was so calm and still, so composed,
that any one would have imagined that
her one thought was how to nurse her
patient. And so it was. Madge felt that
a great deal depended upon her fortitude
and self-control. Had she lost this, she
could not have attended upon Raymond;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and though she was only a weak little girl
in herself, God gave her the strength she
needed. She did not spend her time in idly
fretting, or in gloomy thoughts about the
future; she just did the duties that came in
her way, one by one, and left the rest trustfully
to God.</p>

<p>One glance was sufficient to show Mr.
Smith how ill the boy was. The wildness
of the fever was past, and he had sunk into
a state of almost complete lethargy.</p>

<p>"Madge," said the artist, "I came to see
why you had not come again to me."</p>

<p>Madge only pointed to Raymond's sharpened
features resting on the pillow; it was
excuse enough.</p>

<p>"He is very ill," said Mr. Smith. "I
never saw any one looking more ill."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Smiley says he is dying," said
Madge in a low tone of forced calm; and
she repeated the last words sadly to herself,
"dying, O Raymond!"</p>

<p>"When was the doctor here?"</p>

<p>"We have had no doctor, sir."</p>

<p>"Why not? That has not been wise,
Madge."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/illus_048.png" width="226" height="300" alt="THE ARTIST&#39;S VISIT." title="THE ARTIST&#39;S VISIT." />
<span class="caption">THE ARTIST&#39;S VISIT.</span>
</div>

<p>"We could not afford it, sir."</p>

<p>"There was the parish doctor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew nothing about him, sir; and I
had nobody to tell me."</p>

<p>"Poor child, poor child!" and the artist
was feeling the boy's pulse. Raymond
opened his eyes, and seeing a man by his
side, said faintly, "I've failed, father&mdash;I'll go
to the shop&mdash;it's not done!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, my boy; we must not talk
now." And then Mr. Smith beckoned
Madge into the next room. She followed
him silently, and for a moment or two her
new friend stood looking into her pale,
troubled face. Then he laid his hand on
her head, and there were tears in his eyes
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I have a little daughter at home, Madge,
who is about your age; and if she were in
trouble&mdash;;" suddenly his voice faltered, and
he added hurriedly, "may God grant
that my Lilian may never be left as you
are."</p>

<p>Madge lifted her eyes to his face, then
clasping his hand, she said, "Oh, sir, save
Raymond; I will love you always, if you
will save him. Oh, do not let him die!"</p>

<p>"Keep up your brave little heart; I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
do my best. Madge, if your brother lives,
he will some day be a great artist."</p>

<p>Again that glad, joyful light came into
Madge's eyes, which the artist had seen
there once before. "I know it! I know
it!" she cried. "Did you like the picture,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child. I saw unmistakable
signs of genius in it. I am buying it myself,
little Madge; will you receive the
purchase-money?"</p>

<p>"No, no; wait till Raymond can have
it himself. He must live!&mdash;he will, he
will!"</p>

<p>"Hush, my child; there is One above who
only knows about that; he must do as seemeth
to him best. Now, Madge, go back to
him; I will go and get a friend of mine to
come and see him."</p>

<p>Madge did as he bid her; and in about an
hour Mr. Smith returned with a doctor.</p>

<p>He looked very grave when he had examined
his patient, and then beckoned Mr.
Smith away.</p>

<p>"I have very little hope of him," he said
sorrowfully; "the prostration of strength is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fearful; I fear he will never rally; but
he must have stimulants now, and plenty
of nourishment;&mdash;we must do what we
can."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Smith warmly; "and if
you save him, Morton, you will have saved
one who will be a great man some day.
That boy has an artist's soul within him;
he will rise to fame."</p>

<p>"I should like to save him for the sake
of that little patient maiden who is watching
him. What a touching face the child has,
and how she seemed to be hanging on every
look of mine!"</p>

<p>"Poor little Madge, she loves him better
than herself."</p>

<p>For a few days, Raymond hung between
life and death; then Dr. Morton's face looked
even graver than before. Madge saw that
he had no hope.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, she was sitting beside
her brother, watching the fluttering
breath, which seemed every instant as if
it must cease altogether; when suddenly
Raymond opened his eyes. "Madge."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've been asleep a long time, and I'm so
tired."</p>

<p>"You must try to sleep again, darling
Raymond."</p>

<p>A bewildered look passed over the boy's
face, then he said eagerly, "Madge, am I
going to die?"</p>

<p>She put her face close down to his, and
said gently, "We must not talk now, dear;
try to sleep again."</p>

<p>He was silent for a few minutes, then the
words came thick and fast.</p>

<p>"Madge, I've not been a good brother to
you; I meant to have been, but I have
thought and thought of nothing but myself.
I ought to have gone to the shop. I ought
not to have let you want. O Madge! if I
might but live, if I might but live!" and
then tears fell one by one down the thin,
pale cheeks, and dropped on Madge's hand.</p>

<p>"Please, dear Raymond, lie quiet; the
doctor said you must be very quiet."</p>

<p>"But, Madge, it doesn't signify; I'm
dying, I know I am, and I must speak to
you!" he said, raising his voice, and speaking
with all the energy of those who know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that they are soon to be silent for evermore;
"what will you do? what will become of
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't fear for me, dear brother," answered
Madge, who was crying bitterly.</p>

<p>"No, you love and fear God, and he will
take care of you; I know he will! O Madge,
I wish I had loved him as you have; but
I've been a bad boy, and now it is too late,
too late;&mdash;if I might but live!" The words
were spoken in a low, vehement whisper,
and a smothered groan followed them.</p>

<p>"Raymond, our dear Saviour loves you.
Think of him, do not think about yourself,"
and Madge's face became calm as she spoke.</p>

<p>A smile came over her brother's countenance,
he closed his eyes and feebly pressed
her hand. Then he lay very still and motionless.
Once only his lips moved. Madge
thought he said, "Mother!" Then all was
silent as the grave, except the ticking of the
clock in the next room. Madge seemed
counting every swing of the pendulum.
They seemed like the last grains of sand in
the hour-glass of her brother's life, and his
breath was getting shorter. At length she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
could hardly find out whether he breathed
or not. She thought of what the doctor
said to Mr. Smith: "If he does not rally,
there will probably be a short period of
consciousness before he dies, and then he
will go off quietly." She supposed that
period was over now, and Raymond would
never speak to her again,&mdash;Raymond, her
pride, her glory. He was slipping away
from her, and soon she should have no
brother. Poor little Madge! Years afterwards
she could recall that scene more
vividly than any other in her life&mdash;the look
of everything around her; the lazy flies
creeping up the window-pane, and one or
two which were buzzing about her head; the
glass standing on the chair by Raymond's
side, which she had held to his lips but a
few minutes before, and which she knew he
would never drink from again; the way in
which she had smoothed the bed-clothes and
moved his pillow; and that still, white face,
so inexpressibly dear to her, that rested
upon it. There was a step beside her, and
looking round she saw Mrs. Smiley. The
good woman started as she saw Raymond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Then drawing Madge away, she said tenderly,
"Poor lamb, come in here now;" and
she tried to induce her to leave the room.</p>

<p>"No, no! I must stay," Madge said
vehemently, and she sprang to Raymond's
side. "Mrs. Smiley, he isn't dead."</p>

<p>"Then he looks like it. Come away,
Miss Madge."</p>

<p>"But he isn't. He breathes still."</p>

<p>Yes, there was just a feeble pulsation, so
feeble that it was hardly discernible, but it
brought new hope to Madge's heart. She
moistened his lips with a stimulant, then
knelt beside him, with her eyes fixed upon
him in intense anxiety. The moments
seemed like hours. But at last there came
a little short sigh, and then the breathing
became more soft and regular. The lines of
the face were relaxed, and Raymond was
sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>"If he sleep, he will do well," were words
spoken long ago. And so it was.</p>

<p>When the doctor came again, he pronounced
his patient better, and told Madge
that he might recover.</p>

<p>That night, about twelve o'clock, as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was sitting beside the bed, keeping watch,
Madge heard a low, weak voice saying her
name. She bent down her head, and
Raymond whispered, "Madge, I have had
such a happy, beautiful dream, about my
painting. Ask <span class="smcap">God</span> that I may live."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your dream will come true,
darling, for the picture is sold," she answered
gladly. Then she feared that she had said
what was unwise, and that she had excited
him. But she was satisfied when she saw
the quiet smile of satisfaction that stole over
his features.</p>

<p>"Now rest, dear Raymond," she added,
as she kissed him, "you will yet live to be
my glory."</p>

<h3>THE INVITATION.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/illus_057b_w.png" width="81" height="135" alt="W" title="W" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />HAT a pleasant sight it was to see
Madge's face, when Raymond was
able to sit up. It was still quiet
and calm, but there was a deep
gladness in it that was beautiful;
and the thoughtful care for her brother, the
way in which every wish or desire of his was
forestalled, showed plainly that her love had
rather been increased than diminished by
that long nursing. She made allowance for
all the fretfulness of convalescence, which is
so prevalent after severe illness&mdash;especially
in men or boys, who feel the depression of
extreme weakness peculiarly trying&mdash;and
was always patient and bright. One day
Raymond, after watching her for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
minutes gliding about the room and making
things comfortable for him, said to her,
"Madge, which is the best life, yours or
mine?"</div>

<p>"Mine at present; and yours is going to
be," she answered, with her own quiet smile.</p>

<p>"I've begun to doubt that. Do you
know, I've nearly come to the conclusion
that I would change with you, and that your
unselfish life is more noble than all the fame
and glory I could heap together."</p>

<p>Madge stopped in her work, and looking
earnestly at her brother, replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If that fame and glory is the <i>only</i> object
of your life, Raymond, it is not what I
thought and hoped it was going to be."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, half
laughing at her gravity.</p>

<p>"I can't put it as plainly as I want to do;
but, Raymond, I mean that your painting
will not be only for your own glory, if you
use it rightly."</p>

<p>Raymond was silent, and his face became
very thoughtful. "Madge," he said presently,
"I don't want that arrowroot. Come
over here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait one moment, dear. I know my
duty as nurse better than that. If I leave
this too long it will get quite thin, and then
you will call it 'horrid stuff,' and not taste it."</p>

<p>Raymond laughed. "You are getting
quite tyrannical, Madge. You take an unfair
advantage of my weakness."</p>

<p>"I must make the most of my brief authority,"
she answered merrily; and in another
minute she had brought the little tray to
his side. "Now what is it, Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Well, Madge, I've been thinking a great
deal, and I've come to the conclusion that
it's right for me to go to the shop. I can't
rise to fame in painting without some teaching,
and I can't get that, and I must earn
money for you."</p>

<p>"But, Raymond, that picture is sold.
You know Mr. Smith brought the money
the other day. Why should not others be
sold also?"</p>

<p>"And what are you to do meantime, little
woman?"</p>

<p>Madge was amused at the grave elder-brother
tone, and answered, "As I have
done before. But let us consult Mr. Smith."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well; but he can't know both sides
of the question. Nobody but an artist could
understand what it is to me to give up
painting&mdash;not even you, Madge."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Smith had charged Madge to
keep it a strict secret from Raymond that
he was an artist. He wished to watch him
quietly, for there was a little scheme of benevolence
in the good man's head, which he
wanted to carry out if possible. Many a
time had Madge found herself on the point
of telling Raymond about the sitting, and
Mr. Smith's studio, and the lovely pictures
about it; but she kept her counsel bravely,
and had her reward. Raymond often questioned
her as to how she had made acquaintance
with Mr. Smith, but she always told
him it was through Mr. Jeffery, and turned
the conversation; and by degrees his curiosity
abated, he became content to receive
him as an old friend, and learned to look
forward to his visits as one of his greatest
treats.</p>

<p>But with this secret in her possession, it
was hardly to be wondered at that Madge
smiled when Raymond deplored Mr. Smith's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
probable want of sympathy in his favourite
pursuit; but she only said, "He must have
some taste for painting, or he would not
have bought your picture."</p>

<p>"You little flatterer! he probably did
that because he had a fancy for you."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Smiley entered the
room. She was the bearer of a letter which
had just been left by the postman.</p>

<p>It bore a foreign post-mark, and the children
knew that it was their father's hand-writing.
It contained but a few lines,
evidently written in haste.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Children</span>,&mdash;I have got an appointment abroad,
which will detain me for a long time,&mdash;for how long I cannot
say. I wish I could have you with me&mdash;but this is impossible.
I send you &pound;5. It is all I can do at present.
Raymond must give up his dabbling, and set to work like a
man. I hope you will get on well. I shall see you some day.</p>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;Your affectionate father, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Raymond Leicester.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>And this was all! They had looked
forward to his coming home. They had
watched for him day by day. In Raymond's
heart there was a strange yearning
to see the face of his only living parent;
to know if he would be glad that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
been restored, when he was so near death;
and these few hurried words were all! They
read them through several times. Then
Madge clasped her hands, and hid her face
with a low cry.</p>

<p>"Don't, Madge, don't," said Raymond,
though his own voice was trembling with
emotion. "I cannot bear to see you like
that."</p>

<p>"O Raymond, will he never come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't you see he says that he will,
some day. Meanwhile, we will do our best."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> will never leave me, Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Never, if I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'can can'">can</ins> help it," he said, laying
his long thin fingers on her hair.</p>

<p>"Poor father! Raymond, I did want to
see him so much."</p>

<p>"So did I."</p>

<p>They did not speak much more. For
some time they only sat holding each other's
hands, and thinking mournfully of the future.
Everything seemed very dark and gloomy
that evening, both within and without. A
heavy rain was falling, and the sight of wet
roofs and chimney-pots gleaming in the twilight
is never very enlivening. Raymond at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
last gave a long, deep sigh, at the sound of
which Madge started up.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Raymond. I'm forgetting
my duty as nurse, and it is very bad
for a patient to get vapourish! Oh, here's
Mr. Smith!"</p>

<p>He came in, in his own pleasant, friendly
way, but his quick eye soon discovered that
something was wrong, for Madge's quiet
little face was troubled, and Raymond looked
tired and moody.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith sat down, and began in a lively
tone,&mdash;"Well, Raymond, my boy, how have
things gone to-day? are you any stronger?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir," he answered mournfully.</p>

<p>"And I don't expect you will be, while
you are up here. You want change of air
to set you up."</p>

<p>"I must get well as soon as possible," he
said, with a very determined look.</p>

<p>"You must not be in too great a hurry.
People want a great deal of patching up
after an illness like yours."</p>

<p>"I must be at work!" said Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes, when you are well. What is the
cause of this extreme impatience? You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
were quite content yesterday to lie back in
your chair and let Madge nurse you and pet
you to her heart's content."</p>

<p>Raymond answered by holding out his
father's letter. Mr. Smith read it silently.
He made no remark when he had finished
it, but handed it back to the boy.</p>

<p>"And now, sir, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Get well and strong, my dear boy, in
the first place."</p>

<p>"But about the shop, sir? My father
said the place was ready, and I could take
it."</p>

<p>"You are not fit for it at present."</p>

<p>"At present!" Then Mr. Smith thought
he ought to go when he was well! The
thought was very bitter, and Raymond bent
his head in his hands, and tears came dropping
one by one through his fingers. They
came from his extreme weakness, and he
was very much ashamed of them, so much
ashamed that he did not look up until he
had banished them. Then Mr. Smith
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Little Madge, do you think Raymond
is well enough to have a change?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no place for him to go to, sir,"
she answered, while there was a quick throb
of pain in her heart at the thought of being
separated from him.</p>

<p>"I have a country-house in the Isle of
Wight. Will you both come and pay me
a visit there, and see my little daughter
Lilian?"</p>

<p>Madge's face lit up instantly. "Raymond,
do you hear? The country&mdash;the
country&mdash;and the beautiful sea&mdash;and you
will get strong there!"</p>

<p>"But I don't know how we could do it,
sir?" said Raymond doubtfully, but in a
tone of gladness which showed how much
he liked the proposition.</p>

<p>"You must let me be your father for the
time, and I will see to it all," replied Mr.
Smith kindly. "Mrs. Nurse, don't you
think it would be the best thing possible
for your patient?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered gladly.</p>

<p>"Then you must be ready by the end of
next week," said Mr. Smith; "and consider
that it is a settled thing. Lilian will be in
such delight."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE SURPRISE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 63px;">
<img src="images/illus_066b_s.png" width="63" height="135" alt="S" title="S" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />EAPOINT was beautifully situated
on a headland, which commanded
a view of the boundless sea on one
side, and on the other a panoramic
view of the fertile Isle of Wight.
And this was the summer home of the
artist's little daughter. Her governess,
Miss Mortimer, had charge of her, but her
father came backwards and forwards to see
her constantly; for Lilian was all that was
now left to him in this world to love except
his art, and the days when he came were the
brightest of his little girl's life. She knew
that he would take her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original missing this word">on</ins> long rambling walks,
and let her clamber about amongst the rocks
and little bays and creeks in which she de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>lighted;
and that, when she was tired, there
was always a comfortable resting-place ready
for her in that father's arms; and loving, tender
words, which she never heard from any
one but him. In his little daughter the
artist found his ideal of childish beauty realized.
The exquisitely shaped oval face;
the large eyes of dark blue, through which
the loving little heart looked out at him, and
in which, though generally sparkling with
fun and merriment, there was sometimes a
dreamy intentness, as if they beheld a world
more beautiful than any which his art or imagination
created; the perfectly formed nose
and mouth; the arched forehead, shaded
with golden brown hair; the delicate complexion;
and the witching charm of the
graceful little figure, were a perpetual feast
to the artist-father. Miss Mortimer complained
bitterly that nothing would make
Lilian behave with the due propriety of a
young lady; but to her father there was a
winsomeness in her free, gay manner, that
made up for her wild spirits, which sometimes
carried her past the bounds which the
worthy governess laid down for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></div>

<p>It was one of those glorious evenings in
early summer, when all nature is bathed in
that soft golden light which precedes sunset,
and little Lilian was watching for her father's
arrival; for it was Friday, and he generally
came on that day to stay till Monday.</p>

<p>The eager child had not long to wait;
she heard the well-known footstep on the
gravel, and she bounded out of the door.</p>

<p>"Well, my Lilian."</p>

<p>"Well, papa." And the soft arms were
thrown about his neck as the father stooped
to kiss his little daughter.</p>

<p>"All right here, Fairy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all right. And Miss Mortimer
has got so many good things about me to
tell you; and isn't it fine? Won't you take
me for a beautiful long walk, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling. Shall we go now? I
will just speak to Miss Mortimer, and then
we will set off; and I will ask them to defer
tea until we return."</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" said Lilian. "I will go
and get my hat. Miss Mortimer is in the
school-room, papa."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/illus_069.png" width="295" height="400" alt="EAGER WATCHING." title="EAGER WATCHING." />
<span class="caption">EAGER WATCHING.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Smith walked across the grass, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
entered the school-room by a folding glass-door
that opened upon the lawn. Lilian
returned presently; her shady straw hat
fastened with blue ribbons, a little basket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
on her arm, and her face glowing with pleasure
and excitement.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Mortimer, you said you
would tell papa about my lessons to-day."</p>

<p>The governess, a tall staid lady of about
fifty, whose face betokened that her mind
was full of grammars and dictionaries, smiled
a little, and answered, "I have been informing
your father of the marked improvement
which you have lately made in your
studies."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lily, I have heard all about it,"
said Mr. Smith, looking down fondly into
the bright little face that was raised to his.
"And I have been telling Miss Mortimer of
a treat that I have in store for you."</p>

<p>"What is it, papa?" she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not going to tell you, until we
get to your favourite seat among the rocks."</p>

<p>"Then don't let us lose another minute,
papa," said Lilian, and they set off.</p>

<p>Away over the breezy hill-side which
overhung the sea; away through the furze,
the gorse, and the large brake-ferns; away
until they had left the pretty villa far
behind them, and found themselves in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
small sheltered bay where Mr. Smith's boat,
the <i>White Lily</i>, was moored.</p>

<p>"It is very calm, may we go out for a
little way, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said the artist, as he unfastened
the padlock which moored the
boat. Then he placed Lilian in the stern,
and sprung in himself, taking the oars, and
pushing away from the strand.</p>

<p>The setting sun shed a flood of glory over
the quiet bay, with its brilliantly coloured
rocks, and its shore covered with white
pebbles, and fell upon the little boat that
danced over the rippling sea, lingering lovingly
on the beautiful face of the artist's
child as she bent forward to claim the promised
secret.</p>

<p>"Now, papa, what is the treat?"</p>

<p>"Well, Lily, you know I have told you
about Raymond and Madge."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; and I was going to have
asked how Raymond was, and whether he
liked the fruit I sent him, only the thought
of the treat put it all out of my head."</p>

<p>"He is much better, darling. And what
would you say if you were soon to see him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, papa!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus_072.png" width="300" height="218" alt="EAGER WATCHING." title="EAGER WATCHING." />
<span class="caption">A BEAUTIFUL SCENE.</span>
</div>

<p>"I have asked Madge and him to come
here, that he may recover his strength; and
I have come on to make all preparations.
They will be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, joy, joy!" cried Lilian. "Mayn't
I have a whole holiday, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow you shall; and after that
Madge shall do her lessons with you."</p>

<p>"And Raymond too, papa?"</p>

<p>"No, darling. Raymond will do his lessons
with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall you teach him to paint beautiful
pictures as you do, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so," replied the artist,
smiling.</p>

<p>Lilian drew a long-sigh of contentment.</p>

<p>"I do wish it were to-morrow! Will you
take them out in the boat, papa?"</p>

<p>"Raymond will not be well enough at
first; but by-and-by, I hope, we shall have
some grand excursions."</p>

<p>"And that dear little Madge that you
have told me about; oh, papa, I shall love
her so much! Do you think she will love
me?"</p>

<p>The fond father thought within himself
that it would not be very easy for her to
help doing so; but he only answered, "I
think she will, Lily."</p>

<p>And thus they talked in the pleasant
evening light, until the red sun had dipped
down behind the hills on the further coast;
and then Mr. Smith moored the boat, and
the father and daughter walked home in the
red glow which the sun had left behind it.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed away very
slowly to Lilian, she was looking forward so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
eagerly to the morrow; and it was not until
she had planned and replanned every kind
of pleasure that was likely to be given to her,
during the visit of her friends, and wondered
over and over again what they would be like
that sleep came over her; and before she
knew anything more, the much longed-for
morning had arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith had gone to meet the children
at their landing-place; and about two
o'clock Lilian heard the sound of the
carriage-wheels coming near. Then a fit
of shyness came over her; and she hung
back, so that it was not until she heard her
father's voice calling her that she went to
the door, just in time to see him helping out
of the carriage a tall, delicate-looking boy
of about sixteen, followed by a quiet-looking
little girl of twelve.</p>

<p>"Here are your new friends, Lily; come
and speak to them," said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Then Lilian stepped forward, and shook
hands with Raymond, and kissed Madge.
Madge returned the kiss; but she seemed
intent on watching Raymond, as if she had
no other thought than to take care of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will take Raymond to his room, and
he had better lie down for a while," said
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>The boy smiled faintly, but he was too
tired to speak; so his friend and Madge
helped him to the pretty room which had
been prepared for him, overlooking the
sea.</p>

<p>He lay on the bed with his eyes fixed on
the water; but very soon, overcome with
the fatigue of the journey, he fell asleep;
and when, a little while after, Madge stole
softly into the room, she found him slumbering
peacefully. For an instant she bent
over him, and the dark earnest eyes were
filled with tears of thankfulness that he was
spared to her, and was likely to recover
health and strength in this beautiful home.
Then little Madge drew the curtain across
the window to exclude the light from his
eyes, and left the room as quietly as she had
entered it.</p>

<p>She found Lilian waiting for her at the
foot of the stairs; and before long the two
children had become quite confidential, and
were rapidly making friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening Raymond was allowed to
come down-stairs, and to lie on the sofa in
the pretty drawing-room.</p>

<p>Lilian came to his side with a handful of
bright-coloured geraniums and white roses.
"Papa says you like pretty things; and he
told me I might bring you these."</p>

<p>Raymond took them with a bright smile.
They were not as beautiful as the child who
gave them, glowing as the colours were.</p>

<p>"Are you better?" said Lilian.</p>

<p>"Yes, much better, thank you; I shall
soon be quite well."</p>

<p>"Do you like being here?"</p>

<p>"Very much; and so does Madge," he
answered, laying his hand on hers as she
knelt beside him.</p>

<p>"We are going to have great fun when
you are well again; and I am to have
shorter lessons; and Madge is going to do
lessons with me; and you will do lessons
with papa. He says so."</p>

<p>Raymond lay very still, sometimes looking
out at the sea, sometimes at the "airy
fairy Lilian," by his side, sometimes at the
beautiful pictures around the room. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wonder who painted that one!" he said,
pointing to a likeness of a lovely lady and
child.</p>

<span class="caption">RAYMOND AND LILIAN.</span>
</div>

<p>"It is mamma and me," said Lilian, a
little sadly; and then pointing to one that
hung near it, she said, "I like that picture
better than any."</p>

<p>"Whose is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is done by the great artist, Herbert
Smith," she answered, laughing.</p>

<p>Raymond looked at it with eager delight;
and at this moment Lilian's father entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Chatterbox, I hope you are not tiring
Raymond;" and he looked kindly and inquiringly
at the invalid.</p>

<p>"Not the least, sir; I was thinking that
you are fortunate to possess so many of the
paintings of Herbert Smith. How beautiful
they are!" and the young artist's eye
kindled with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>His new friend smiled.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of painting, Raymond."</p>

<p>"You must be, sir, from the way you
have talked to me about it, and from your
having such beautiful pictures. Do you
paint yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why, Raymond," said Lilian, "don't
you know&mdash;;" but a warning look from her
father stopped her saying anything more.
She only looked over at Madge, with her
large blue eyes full of laughter.</p>

<p>Then her father bent down over the boy,
and said, "I paint a great deal, Raymond."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" said Raymond
eagerly. "Then you will not think it
wrong of me to want to be an artist."</p>

<p>"So far from thinking it wrong, Raymond,
I am going to help you in it. I am
going to get you taught."</p>

<p>A bright flush came over Raymond's face
as he looked up for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Who will teach me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Herbert Smith."</p>

<p>Raymond started up. "Do you know
him, sir? Do you know Mr. Smith, the
greatest artist that is living? Is he a
relation of yours?"</p>

<p>"Raymond, I am Herbert Smith," said
his friend kindly.</p>

<p>A look of wondering doubt passed over
the boy's face, which quickly changed to one
of intense veneration, almost of reverence,
at feeling himself in the presence of this
master mind. Then, as the thought of all
his friend's former kindness came over him,
and of this great privilege before him, he
covered his face with his hands; and the
tears, which he vainly tried to conceal, fell
through his thin fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE SURPRISE.</span>
</div>

<p>Madge bent down over him. "Raymond,
dear Raymond, look up. Do not be sad
now, it is all joy."</p>

<p>"I am so glad, I cannot help it, Madge,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
said Raymond. "All my brightest dreams
coming true. I shall be an artist yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith turned away his head, his heart
deeply moved by the boy's delight; but
Lilian could not restrain her gladness.</p>

<p>"And did you not know that papa was
the great Herbert Smith?" she asked.
"What fun! Did you know, Madge?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Madge, looking shyly into
Raymond's face.</p>

<p>"O Madge, how <i>could</i> you let me go on
talking to Mr. Smith about my poor little
paintings without telling me."</p>

<p>"He told me not to tell you," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Smith; "I wanted, Raymond,
to watch you for a little while, before
you knew who I was. I wanted to see if
your whole heart was really devoted to
painting, and that you were likely to rise in
your profession, before I offered you assistance.
I am satisfied; and now shake hands:
if you are willing to endure a life of labour,
I think I can promise you success."</p>

<p>"I am willing for anything," said Raymond.
And to Madge he whispered, "You
shall glory in me some day, little sister."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE SUCCESS.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 73px;">
<img src="images/illus_045b_a.png" width="73" height="130" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />ND the day came, after years of
patient labour.</div>

<p>The morning sun shone in
brightly upon a room, in one of
those pleasant villas which abound
in the suburbs of London. A
party were assembled at breakfast&mdash;an old,
infirm man, and his son and daughter. The
old man was Mr. Leicester, and the other
two were Raymond and Madge. Their
father had come back to them, broken
down in health and spirits. Raymond met
him accidentally in the streets of London,
and brought him to the little home where
he and Madge lived, and they had cared for
him tenderly ever since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>We last saw Raymond and Madge almost
as children; we find them now grown up.
Raymond's character has deepened. He is
a great artist, and a great man also&mdash;for,
added to the depth and strength of mind
which the mastery of one subject gives,
there were many noble traits in him&mdash;and
many men now feel themselves privileged
if they call Raymond Leicester their
friend.</p>

<p>Madge has the same character, and nearly
the same face, as she had when a child.
She is still Raymond's fireside genius, and
a dutiful, tender daughter to her father.</p>

<p>But we were speaking of that sunshiny
morning when they were at breakfast. A
newspaper lay by Raymond's side, and
when he had sipped his coffee he unfolded
it. "The Academy is open, Madge," he
said quickly; then ran his eye down the
long columns.</p>

<p>Madge looked up eagerly, and saw the
deepening colour in his cheek as he read.
She took up the paper as he laid it down,
quickly found the place, and her heart
bounded as she read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<span class="caption">THE NOTICE IN THE NEWSPAPER.</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But, without doubt, the picture which attracts most
notice is the one which Mr. Raymond Leicester exhibits.
We feel, as we study it, that we are gazing on the work of a
great man, and a deservedly famous artist. He has not
belied the early promise of his youth; and that man must
have but little taste and good feeling who can move away,
after the contemplation of this masterpiece, without feeling
that he is the better for having seen it," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The tears blinded Madge, so that she could
read no more. But what more was there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for her to read? The wish of her life was
fulfilled. Raymond was a great artist&mdash;the
world proclaimed him so&mdash;and he was her
brother, her pride, and her glory.</p>

<p>"Little Madge," and Raymond's hand
rested with its caressing touch upon her
head, "I feel that I owe it all to you."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/illus_086.png" width="228" height="300" alt="IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY." title="IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY." />
<span class="caption">IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY.</span>
</div>

<p>"No, no," she answered, laying her hand
upon his. "No, not to me&mdash;to Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"Noble-hearted man!" said Raymond
warmly; and then his voice sunk so low
that only Madge could hear it. "I will go
and ask for Lilian to-day."</p>

<p>"God speed you!" said Madge, smiling
through her tears; "and papa and I will go
and look at your picture in the Academy."</p>

<p>Anybody who had been in the Royal
Academy that morning would have seen a
feeble old man leaning on the arm of his
daughter, lingering near the picture round
which every one thronged. Madge was
feasting on their praise of it, and repeating
chosen bits to her father, who was very
proud of his son now. It was a happy day
to Madge, as she looked at the picture, and
felt that Raymond was worthy of the praise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that was bestowed upon it. She thanked
God in her heart that he had spared Raymond's
life, and allowed her to see this day.</p>


<p>Raymond gained Lilian for his wife, but
he is "Madge's glory" still.</p>

<h3>A LONELY LIFE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/illus_087b_m.png" width="80" height="135" alt="M" title="M" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br />R. VALENTINE SHIPTON was
one of the wealthiest farmers in
Dilbury; and yet every one pitied
him. He did not ask them to do
so, but they could not help it, he
seemed so lonely and forlorn in the world.
Nobody loved him, unless it might be the
big cat which slept by his fireside; and even
she did not care very much about him, so
that she was left undisturbed in the possession
of her own corner. Every day Mr.
Shipton walked out and took a survey of
his premises, gave directions to his men, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
then returned to his large, old-fashioned,
dreary-looking parlour, and smoked his pipe
over the fire in the winter, or in his front
porch in summer. Every Sunday he took
down his best hat from its peg, and his large
red Prayer Book from the shelf, and walked
to the village church; but he never spoke
to any one either going or returning, and
even the little children shrunk away from
him as he passed them.</div>

<p>No one ever came across the threshold of
Dilbury Farm, except the tenants to pay
their rent to him, or his men to receive their
wages; and Mr. Shipton never went away
except to the neighbouring fairs, and then
he always returned in the evening, looking
more moody than ever.</p>

<p>Picture then the astonishment of the old
woman called Betty, who cooked his dinner,
when her master, one evening in December,
suddenly came into the kitchen, and taking
his pipe from his mouth, said,&mdash;"Betty, I'm
going to London to-morrow, and most likely
I shall be away for a fortnight!"</p>

<p>"To London, master! why, that be many
miles off!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it is, Betty; and mind you lock
up the house every evening at six o'clock,
and never allow any one across the door-step."</p>

<p>Betty was too much astonished to make
any answer, she only smoothed down her
apron very vigorously, and gazed at her
master as if he were slightly demented.
Then a sudden idea occurred to her, and she
gasped out, "Then, master, you'll want your
best shirts put up; and I must see to it, and
get the ruffles done up quick."</p>

<p>Farmer Shipton gave her no answer, but
turned round and left the room.</p>

<p>"Sure it's some mistake," said old Betty
musingly, as she put her irons in the fire;
"he'll change again before to-morrow."</p>

<p>But Mr. Shipton did not change; and
the next morning early his gig was at
the door, his old-fashioned portmanteau
was put into it, and presently the old man
himself got in and drove off as fast as the
old mare was disposed to go. This part of
the journey was all very well, and the
farmer felt in better spirits than usual; the
sky was bright and clear above him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the gig went on smoothly enough over the
well-made road to the station. But the
train was an invention which Mr. Shipton
utterly despised, and when he found himself
seated in the railway carriage, and in quicker
motion than he had ever experienced before,
he felt inclined to stop at the first station
and go back to Dilbury at a more reasonable
pace. However, he had a motive for
going to London, and so he resisted his inclination,
and was whirled on until he arrived
at the great metropolis. After a most
confusing search for his portmanteau, he
discovered it being whisked off by another
man; but having succeeded at last in obtaining
possession of it, and taking his place
in an omnibus, he was soon rattling away
over the paved streets in the direction of
Islington. The omnibus deposited him at
the corner of a street, and there he found
a boy who was willing to carry his luggage
to a small and retired row of houses which
was his destination.</p>

<p>"Which house?" said the lad when they
had reached Crown Row. Farmer Shipton
stopped, drew his spectacles from out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
their hiding-place under his waistcoat, placed
them on his nose, and then felt in his pocket
for a leather pocket-book, which generally
lived there. When he had opened it, he
turned over the papers one by one&mdash;receipts
for money, farm accounts, bills, &amp;c.&mdash;until he
came to two letters tied together. These
he drew out. One of them was written in
a trembling, almost illegible hand, and the
other had a deep black edge to it&mdash;it was to
this one he referred, and then folding it up
again and replacing them both in the pocket-book,
he turned to the boy and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. Five, boy&mdash;but stay, I want a
lodging first; I must leave my box somewhere
before I go out visiting."</p>

<p>"No. Five&mdash;and here be lodgings to let,"
said the boy with a grin.</p>

<p>"The very thing," said the old farmer,
rubbing his hands; and then he added to
himself, "Now I can watch the state of
things quietly, without saying anything to
anybody; I'll see what these folks are made
of."</p>

<p>He knocked at the door and it was
opened by a tidy little girl, whose face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
would have been pretty if the fresh air of
the country had brought the roses into it;
at least so Farmer Shipton thought, as she
dropped a courtesy to him.</p>

<p>"Lodgings to let here?" he inquired in
his own gruff, surly tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Got a room that would do me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I think so."</p>

<p>"Mother at home, girl, or your missus?"</p>

<p>"Mother is, sir; will you please to walk
inside?"</p>

<p>"Put down the box, lad, and here's your
sixpence;&mdash;shameful charge to make; why,
in the part I come from, a bigger lad than
you would have got no more for a whole
day's work; but it's my belief this London
is made up of thieves and fools! Here's a
staircase dark as midnight! Why, they say
country folks come to town to be <i>enlightened</i>&mdash;but
it doesn't seem much like it! Thieves
and fools&mdash;thieves and fools. Thieves to
do the fools, and fools to be done by the
thieves!" Thus grumbling, he got up the
first flight of stairs, and paused at a door
which the little girl who guided him opened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
And here <i>we</i> must pause for a moment, just
to say that Farmer Shipton, for reasons
best known to himself, dropped his name
outside the door, and entered that room as
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman, dressed in rather
rusty black, and wearing a widow's cap,
stood up as he appeared, and laid down
some very fine needlework, which she was
engaged upon. A girl about a year younger
than the little maiden who had opened the
door, was sitting on a low stool by her
mother's side, cutting out a paper-pattern;
and a boy of about nine years old was
stretched on the rag-mat fast asleep. The
room was scrupulously neat, but very poorly
furnished; and the old farmer looked round
keenly as he stood on the threshold.
"Hum!" he said to himself, "no extravagance
here, most certainly!" but aloud
he said, "I want a lodging; are there any
to be had?"</p>

<p>"I have got a nice bedroom, sir; I'll
show you," said the widow; "and you can
have a small sitting-room down-stairs; but I
only own the upper flight of this house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hum! one room would do!&mdash;can I
board with you?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, our lodgers don't generally
do that, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't take the room unless I do," he
interrupted; "I've not come to London to
squander <i>my</i> cash, I can tell you."</p>

<p>There was a struggle in the widow's
mind; she sorely wanted money, and she
might not have another chance of letting
the room. This grumpy old man might
prove pleasanter on further acquaintance;
at <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'anyrate'">any rate</ins> he might not be so disagreeable
as many another; and with one glance at
her little sick boy upon the rug, the mother
made up her mind and decided to take her
lodger as a boarder.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was quite satisfied with his
room, and though he pretended to grumble
at the price asked for it, he really thought
it moderate; so he unpacked his portmanteau,
laid the shirts which Betty had done
up so speedily and well in a drawer, and
then sat down once more to read the letters
which he had consulted before knocking at
the door of No. 5. Shall we read them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
too? it may, perhaps, give us some clue
to the old man's secret.</p>

<p>The first, as we said before, was written
in a trembling hand, and hardly legible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Father,</span>&mdash;If I had strength and health to do
it, I would come to you, and never leave off asking your
pardon until you had given it. Father, I am dying, and
these few words are the prayer of a dying man. It was
wrong to leave you, even though I didn't like the country,
and longed for the great city&mdash;it was wrong to leave you all
alone in your sorrow. If Val had lived he would have been
a better son to you than me&mdash;may God forgive me. You
will get this, father, when perhaps it is too late; but if you
have any pity, any love left for your boy, come to me once
more&mdash;<i>once more</i>, father! I am leaving my wife and four
children quite unprovided for; will you be a father to them?
I do not ask it for <i>my</i> sake, but for their helplessness&mdash;the
fatherless and the widow&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>Here the trembling hand had failed, and
a blot of ink showed that the pen had fallen
from the writer's hand; it was taken up to
add,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">"Come to me, dear father, and forgive your dying son.<br />

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Alan Shipton.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>The father had <i>not</i> gone, and the next
letter was from the widow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;My husband is dead&mdash;almost his last words
were, 'Will father come in time?'&mdash;he longed to see you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
once more. He suffered very much at the last, but he was
very happy, and I look forward to meeting him again in the
land where there is no more parting. I have moved to
smaller rooms with my children, at No. 5 Crown Row,
Islington, where I have taken the top flight in the house,
and hope to find a lodger to take the one room which we
shall not occupy. I shall be able to earn sufficient money,
I hope, by dressmaking to support myself and my three
youngest children&mdash;my eldest boy Alan has gone to sea. I
wish I could think that my dear husband had your entire
forgiveness.&mdash;I remain, sir, yours dutifully,</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Ellen Shipton.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>The date of this letter was a year old,
and the farmer had written underneath it,
"Hypocrites! I know town folks better
than they think!"</p>

<p>Why then was he reading it over? Why
was he in this house under the name of Mr.
Smith? Why had he after so many months
come to seek out these unknown relations?
It was because the old man's heart was
lonely&mdash;because underneath his gruff exterior
he had a kindly heart&mdash;because he
longed to have some one who would care for
him and comfort his old age. This was why
he had left his country home to come up to
the great city. He had determined to find
out his son's family, with the purpose of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
adopting one of the children, if he found
that the faults which he believed to be inherent
in all children of the town were
such as he could get rid of without much
trouble to himself; but he thought it would
be easier to watch them if they did not
know who he was; for, as he said to himself,
"they are quite cunning enough to
deceive me&mdash;town children always are."
And now having given you this little insight
into the old man's mind, let us return to the
widow's room and make acquaintance with
her and her children.</p>

<p>"Mother," whispered Ellen, the little girl
who had opened the door to the stranger,
"is he really to be with us all day? How
horrid it will be!"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear; don't let us think of
that, let us think of the money we shall get,
and all the good it will do our little Maurice.
Poor child! how pale he looks there on the
rug!"</p>

<p>"He looks like father did," said Janet,
the second daughter, who was cutting out
the pattern by her mother's side. A shudder
passed through Mrs. Shipton's frame, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for one moment she raised her hand to her
face with an expression of pain.</p>

<p>"Janet, don't say that," whispered Ellen.
"It hurts mother."</p>

<p>Janet looked up. "Mother, dear, I didn't
mean it. I didn't mean so bad. Maurice
is better than he was, isn't he? He had
quite a colour this morning, and was not so
tired as he was yesterday; and by the time
Alan comes home, I expect he will be quite
well."</p>

<p>Her mother put her work down for a
minute, and laid her hand upon Janet's fair
hair&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good little girl, I didn't think you
meant to pain me, and I know how you love
your little brother. You both help me
beautifully in taking care of him, and if it's
God's will I think he will get quite well&mdash;but
he sadly wants care. If your dear
grandmother was alive, I'd send him into
the country to her for a little bit, to my old
home. I know <i>that</i> fresh air would soon
make him well again."</p>

<p>"Mother, I'd like to see your home. The
house with the roses growing over it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the school where grandmother taught, and
the church, and the green fields, and the
hills, and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Janet; here's the old gentleman."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith came in and sat down. First
he cleared his throat, then settled his stiff
cravat, crossed his legs, and looked round
on the little party.</p>

<p>"Girls go to school, Mrs.&mdash;what's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Shipton, sir, Mrs. Shipton. No, sir, my
little girls stop at home and help me."</p>

<p>"Help, hum! not much help in them,
never is in town girls&mdash;think of nothing but
lark and fine dresses. Do they earn anything?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not yet; they will by-and-by,
but I think they do quite enough now in
helping me."</p>

<p>"Hum! got any more children, Mrs.
Shipton?"</p>

<p>"One boy at sea, sir."</p>

<p>"At sea!&mdash;ran away?"</p>

<p>"No!" burst indignantly from Janet and
Ellen; "he went because he got a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
chance; and he didn't like going, but he said
he wouldn't stop and burden mother."</p>

<p>"He's a good son, sir&mdash;my boy Alan!"
said the mother proudly.</p>

<p>"Alan!" said the old man, lingering on
the name; "why do you call him that?"</p>

<p>"It was his father's name, sir," said the
widow, as she bent her head lower over her
work.</p>

<p>Ellen noticed that the old gentleman bit
his lip and looked down on the ground, and
she thought he must be rather kind, because
he did not ask any more questions, and did
not look at her mother's sad face.</p>

<p>At this moment Maurice roused himself
from his heavy sleep, and looked round in
stupid, slumbering wonder upon the stranger
who seemed to have made himself so much
at home.</p>

<p>Janet ran to his side, and eagerly whispered
the news, while Maurice rubbed his
eyes and took a good look at the new-comer.</p>

<p>"Hum! not much stuff in that little
chap," said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"He has been very ill," replied the mother,
looking anxiously at her youngest child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doctor's bill to pay, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered hastily.</p>

<p>"Make haste, boy, and get well&mdash;sick
boys are expensive things."</p>

<p>"What a queer man," said little Maurice.</p>

<p>"Come, Maury, come to mother's room,
and I'll put you neat," said Ellen kindly, as
she took his little thin hand and led him away.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Smith put on his spectacles and
drew the paper from his pocket, and spoke
no more until tea-time.</p>

<p>After that meal was over, the mother
went out to deliver her parcel of work, and
the two little girls sat down with their
sewing.</p>

<p>Suddenly their lodger spoke: "Do you
like stories, children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes!" they answered eagerly,
while a look of pleasure came over Maurice's
pale, shy face.</p>

<p>"What shall it be about?"</p>

<p>"Do you know much about the country,
sir?" said Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, my girl, more than most folks."</p>

<p>"Please, then, tell us about that," said
Ellen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man looked satisfied, and began
a long description of the country delights
of his boyhood. The children listened attentively
to them; it was like some fairy
tale, or a story of enchanted ground.</p>

<p>"Father used to tell us things like that,"
said little Janet.</p>

<p>"Did he?" said the old man quickly.
"Did your father love the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he ran away and left it, because
he thought he would like the town
better," replied Ellen.</p>

<p>"And did he?" asked the stranger, while
he looked keenly into the little girl's face.</p>

<p>"No," she answered thoughtfully. "He
said it wasn't right of him, and that he had
often wished himself back again there;&mdash;but
I don't believe father ever did what was
wrong."</p>

<p>"Hum!" Mr. Smith suddenly looked
away towards the fire and cleared his throat
violently; as he did so, his eyes rested on
little Maurice, who was sitting on his little
stool in the chimney-corner, with the firelight
falling on his face. The old man
started and muttered low, "Alan, my little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lad!" Then gave an impatient pshaw! and
turned again to Ellen.</p>

<p>"The river ran right through the fields,
and my brother used to bathe in it, and fish&mdash;ay,
many's the hour we've spent on its
banks with a rod and basket&mdash;many's the dish
we've brought back in pride to our mother."</p>

<p>Suddenly Maurice got up and came to his
side. "Did you ever see a boy drowned?"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked at the child in silent
amazement for a moment, but Maurice repeated
his question.</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the old man in a tremulous
voice, while his hands shook as he clasped
them together.</p>

<p>"Uncle Val was drowned," Maurice went
on, "quite drowned in the water&mdash;father
said so&mdash;he was drowned deep down under
the willow-trees."</p>

<p>"Hush, Maury dear; it was very dreadful:
father used to sigh when he spoke of
Uncle Val, and Maurice is always thinking
about him; please, forgive him, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith did not answer, and at this
moment the mother came in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The children received her with delight,
telling her, immediately upon her entrance,
that Mr. Smith came from the country, and
could tell beautiful stories. Mrs. Shipton
thanked him gratefully for being so kind to
her little ones, and began to feel more comfortable
about the expediency of having
admitted him into their family circle.</p>

<p>It was soon time for the children to go
to bed; but before he left the room, little
Maurice knelt down beside his mother and
said his evening prayer. Mr. Smith watched
the child with curious attention as he prayed,
and once or twice with a sudden abruptness
he cleared his throat and crossed and uncrossed
his legs.</p>

<p>Maurice never raised his head, but went
on with the simple words, "Bless dear
mother, and Nellie, and Janet; and take care
of Alan out on the sea this night, and bring
him safe home; and bless grandfather, and
take care of him now that he is an old man.
For Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."</p>

<p>Why did the lodger start? Why did he
so hastily dash his hand across his eyes,
then stand up and go to his own room?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
When there, why did the old man let the
bitter scalding tears run down his cheeks?
why did those broken, mournful words come
from his lips,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alan! Alan! my son; would God I
had died for thee, Alan, my son!" He
paused, then went on more sorrowfully:&mdash;"Why,
why did you leave me, if you loved
me? Oh, my boy! why did you break my
heart, Alan?&mdash;Dead! dead! and I am alone
now; yet you taught <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original missing this word">your</ins> children to pray for
the lonely old man. Bless you, my boy&mdash;too
late&mdash;too late&mdash;my blessing would have
made you happy in life, but now it can do
nothing for you."</p>

<p>Then the old man put his head outside
the door, and called to Ellen, who was passing,
to say that he was going to bed.</p>

<p>But it was long before sleep came to him,
for he lay thinking of the old days, long
ago, when children had loved him, when
life had been sunny and warm,&mdash;why had it
grown so chill and cold of late? Ah,
Farmer Shipton, there is but one thing
which can make life full of warmth and
sunshine, and that is the love of God.</p>

<h3>TRANSPLANTED DAISIES.</h3>

</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br /> &nbsp;MONTH soon passed away, and
old Mr. Smith had become quite
one of the household. He was
very kind in his manner to the
children, though sometimes blunt
and abrupt, but he seemed constantly
to be watching their mother, with a
suspicion which she could not understand.
However, he was out a great deal, and she
did not find him at all in the way, and she
was glad the children had made friends
with him.</div>

<p>"Mother, I like Mr. Smith; he's very
good to us; but isn't he a funny man?"
said Ellen one evening, and she looked up
from her work as she spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think he's very kind to you, my dear,
and you are quite right to like him," replied
Mrs. Shipton slowly, for there was something
about her lodger which she could not
understand; and she was not quite sure
whether she liked him or not.</p>

<p>"He goes out to see London, doesn't he,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has never been here before,
and there is plenty for a stranger to see."</p>

<p>"But, mother."</p>

<p>"Well, Ellen?"</p>

<p>"I think he's very kind, and all that;
but I don't think he's happy: often and often
when I look up, I see him looking at me
with his eyes full of tears. Isn't it odd and
queer for a man to cry. Father never
cried."</p>

<p>Mrs. Shipton did not answer; why should
the child know of all the bitter tears which
her father had shed?</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Smith has some trouble
that we do not know of, dear."</p>

<p>"I think he has, mother; but wasn't it
kind of him to get that bottle of wine for
Maurice?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; poor little Maurice! Ellen, I
sometimes think&mdash;," and the mother's voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"What, mother?"</p>

<p>"I think he's going from me too;" and
the poor woman put down her work, and
bowed her head in her hands.</p>

<p>Little Ellen came up close to her mother,
and slipping her arm round her neck, laid
her face close to hers, and whispered,
"Mother, mother, don't cry&mdash;God will take
care of Maurice; he won't let him die."</p>

<p>"I think sometimes that he will, he is so
like poor father, and he seems so delicate
and weakly, and I have no means of getting
him the strengthening things he needs."</p>

<p>"But, mother, he is better than he
was."</p>

<p>"Not much, dear; he has never got over
that illness, and sometimes I think that he
will not live much longer; but I cannot let
him go&mdash;my boy&mdash;my youngest&mdash;my little
Maurice."</p>

<p>"Mother, we will pray to God to make
him well; and you say God always hears
us when we pray."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear, yes, he does; pray to him,
dear Nellie; we will all pray to him to spare
little Maurice."</p>

<p>The mother and daughter had not perceived
that Mr. Smith had entered the
room, and was standing opposite to them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, eh? what's the
matter?" said the old man, as Ellen
looked up, and he caught sight of the tears
on her cheeks. Mrs. Shipton got up quickly
and hurried out of the room; and Ellen
dried her eyes, and busied herself in putting
the work away.</p>

<p>Just then Janet came in with Maurice,
and they eagerly claimed a story from Mr.
Smith. The old man looked earnestly at
them for a minute, and then said, "I don't
know any story to-night, little ones."</p>

<p>"Then tell us something about the
country," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"You should see a corn-field, children;
that's the sight," said Mr. Smith. "Oh,
how you'd like to see them binding up the
sheaves, and how quickly the sickles cut
down the ripe grain!"</p>

<p>"But don't the men cut down beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
flowers at the same time?" said Janet.
"Father used to tell us about the flowers."</p>

<p>The old man was silent for a moment,
and then said quickly, "Flowers&mdash;ah! poor
children, you don't know what flowers are
here, in your smoky, dirty town."</p>

<p>"What kind of flowers grow in the
country?" said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Why, there's primroses, and violets, and
roses, and honeysuckle, and poppies, and
a hundred things."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got flowers in the town
too," said Janet.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Mr. Smith incredulously.
"I haven't discovered them yet, except a
few things, stunted and withered, and all
boxed up in smoky gardens."</p>

<p>Janet smiled to herself, and determined
that she would show the country stranger
the truth of her words.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and Mr. Smith
went to the nearest church with Ellen and
Janet, while Mrs. Shipton stayed at home
with Maurice.</p>

<p>Janet did not return with the others, but
when they had been in a few minutes, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bounding footstep was heard on the stairs,
and she entered with a whole handful of
daisies, which she held out triumphantly to
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried, "there are flowers in
the town!"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith laughed. "Where did these
come from, little one?"</p>

<p>"Out of the churchyard, from off father's
grave," said Janet, dropping her voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith took up the flowers and looked
at them as if he was trying to discover how
they were made, so intently were his eyes
bent upon them.</p>

<p>"Mother says we are like daisies, sometimes,"
said Janet merrily.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>The child coloured, and did not answer;
but Mrs. Shipton replied for her,&mdash;"Because
whenever I am gloomy and unhappy, these
children brighten me and cheer me by looking
up to the sun; they always find out a
sunny side to my troubles."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith laid his hand lightly on Janet's
head, and said, "I have learnt many things
since I came to London, but I did not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that I should find country flowers in this
large, wicked place."</p>

<p>"We value them more because they are
not plenty, and because we have not many
other things," said Mrs. Shipton.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;well, can town daisies be transplanted,
think you?"</p>

<p>Ellen looked wonderingly at the old man,
for she saw that his eyes were fixed on Janet
with a meaning smile, but the little girl herself
seemed quite unconscious of it, and
answered quickly, "If you have plenty of
flowers in the country, you don't want
them."</p>

<p>The strange lodger laughed, but it was a
rather sad laugh. "I do want them," he
answered; and then, after pausing for a
minute or two, he went on abruptly, "Mrs.
Shipton, I've been a month with you,
haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I must go home to-morrow; now,
I've got something to say to you. You're
not rich, and there's no nonsense about you
to pretend you are."</p>

<p>The widow's colour was heightened, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
she had grown accustomed to her lodger's
abrupt manner of speaking, so she took no
notice of his remark, and he went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm a lonely old man, and have neither
chick nor child to care for me. I didn't
believe anything pure and innocent could
be found in this place; but I've discovered
some daisies, and I want to dig up one and
take it back to my home."</p>

<p>"I'll dig up one for you to-morrow," said
Janet eagerly; but Mrs. Shipton saw his
meaning, and she became very pale, and
looked anxiously at her child.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said the old man,
putting his arm round her. "Now, I want
you to come and be my own little girl, and
live with me in the country."</p>

<p>"And go away from mother?" said
Janet, lifting her eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"Yes; come and be mine, and perhaps I'd
bring you to see your mother sometimes."</p>

<p>Janet looked away to her mother, and
saw that her eyes were full of tears; then
she sprang into her mother's arms and hid
her face on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I will promise to take all care of her,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
said the old man; "and the country would
do her all the good in the world."</p>

<p>"I can't leave mother! no, no, no!" sobbed
little Janet.</p>

<p>"I would adopt her for my own, and
provide for her liberally," said Mr. Smith.
"Come, Mrs. Shipton, you're a sensible
woman, you know how much better it would
be for your child."</p>

<p>"I cannot give her up, sir," said the
mother anxiously; "she is too young to
leave me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, may I have Ellen?"</p>

<p>Ellen shrank to her mother's side. "No,
no!" she whispered. A disappointed look
crossed the old man's face. "Come, Mrs.
Shipton, you are slaving your life away for
these children, will you lose so good a chance
of providing for one of them?"</p>

<p>"I'll go if I ought, mother, if it would be
better for you and the others," said Ellen
bravely; but she put her hands over her
face, that her mother might not see how
much those words cost her.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the widow firmly, as she
drew her children closely to her; "God has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
given me these children, and he will give
me the means of keeping them."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith cleared his throat violently.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he muttered, "I suppose I
must live and die&mdash;lonely&mdash;lonely."</p>

<p>Mrs. Shipton's eye wandered wistfully to
Maurice, who was looking on with eyes full
of wonder.</p>

<p>"Sir, you are very, very kind," she said,
and then paused.</p>

<p>"Don't talk of it&mdash;I can't get what I
want," said the old man.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear giving up one of them,"
said the widow; "but there's Maurice,&mdash;the
child is ill, I believe he will die here in the
town, but he might live in the country; will
you take him, sir?" and then, having said
thus much, Mrs. Shipton quite broke down,
and hid her face among Janet's curls.</p>

<p>At this moment the conversation was
interrupted by a scream from Maurice, as
the door was opened, and a boy in a sailor's
dress stood amongst them.</p>

<p>"Alan!"</p>

<p>"My boy, my boy!" and Mrs. Shipton
held out her arms to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/illus_116.png" width="278" height="380" alt="ALAN&#39;S RETURN." title="ALAN&#39;S RETURN." />
<span class="caption">ALAN&#39;S RETURN.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Smith looked at him for a minute,
and then putting his hand to his head, he
hastily left the room. It seemed as if he
saw his own Alan again, in all the strength<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and beauty of his boyhood. Before the lodger
returned to the sitting-room, Alan had been
told who he was, and what he wanted to do;
and though he thought for Maurice's sake
it was best, the way in which his arm was
twisted round his little brother's neck, told
how sore a trial it would be to part with him.
Maurice alone was unmoved; the thought of
the country seemed to have great attractions
for him, and Mr. Smith's stories and general
kindness had quite won his heart. Mr.
Smith lifted him on to his knee, but did not
speak a word, for he was looking intently
at Alan all the time.</p>

<p>"Do you like being at sea, Alan?" asked
Janet.</p>

<p>Alan shook his head, but said quickly,
"Janet, it doesn't matter what one likes;
it's what's best;" and a brave courageous
smile came upon the boy's handsome face.</p>

<p>"Isn't he like his father?" whispered
Mrs. Shipton to Ellen.</p>

<p>"Yes; he smiles just like him," said
Ellen.</p>

<p>"Just like him," said Mr. Smith, in a low,
deep voice, that startled them all. Maurice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was frightened, and slipped down off his
knee, and Ellen looked in her mother's face
in silent astonishment. "Alan, Alan, my
son!" and the old man rose up and came over
to the sailor-boy's side. Alan stood up, and
his grandfather put one hand on his shoulder,
passed his hand over his dark curly hair, and
then drawing him closely into his arms, said,
while the tears ran down his cheeks, "Alan,
be my son, instead of him that's gone."</p>

<p>"Who is it, mother?" asked Maurice
fearfully.</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith, or, as we may now call him
again by his rightful name, old Farmer
Shipton, answered, "I am the grandfather
whom you have been taught to pray for!
Ellen, my daughter, my own Alan's wife,
forgive me; I am your father now!"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Shipton came to him, knelt
down beside him, and laying her hand in his,
said, "Alan always said you would come!
Father, have you forgiven him?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said the old man; "may God forgive
me as freely. And now, daughter Ellen, you
must never leave me; and your children
must be mine, and I must have you all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Alan will leave the sea and become my
eldest son, and there's room in the old house
for you all. Will you come, little daisy?"
and Janet smiled gladly as she answered,
"Yes, grandfather."</p>

<p>"God be thanked for all he has taught
me in this room," said Farmer Shipton.
"Ellen, my little one, will you love me
too?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Ellen shyly; "but why
did you want us to leave mother?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the old man gravely.
"I came to London for the purpose of finding
out if there was any good in any of you;
and then I could not make up my mind to
telling you who I was, until I had watched
you and tried you to the utmost; but when
I saw Alan, I could wait no longer.&mdash;Alan,
will you be my son? I'm an old man, and
all alone."</p>

<p>The sailor-boy went to his mother's side,
and looking into her tearful face fondly, he
said, "Mother, what do <i>you</i> say?"</p>

<p>A smile crossed her lips as she looked at
him proudly, and answered, "Be as good a
son to your grandfather as you are to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Alan, for that would have pleased your
father. Oh, if he could but know this!"</p>

<p>Then Alan shook hands with his grandfather,
and said, "Will you teach me to be
a farmer, sir? We'll all like to live with
you very much."</p>

<p>A few evenings after, the whole party
were comfortably established in the old
farmhouse at Dilbury, to Betty's great
delight and astonishment.</p>

<p>The anxious mother soon had the pleasure
of seeing the colour brought back into the
cheeks of her little Maurice; and Janet and
Ellen made acquaintance with the delights
of country life. They often came home from
woodland rambles laden with wild-flowers,
which they exhibited with pride and delight;
but their grandfather always declared that
no flowers would ever appear so beautiful to
him as his own little Town Daisies!</p>
